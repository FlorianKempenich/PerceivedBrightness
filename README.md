## Result
![sorted by perceived brightness](https://github.com/FlorianKempenich/PerceivedBrightness/raw/master/results/sorted_by_perceived_brightness.png)

## Steps

### 1. Map each pixel to its perceived brightness 
This is the only step where [the script](https://github.com/FlorianKempenich/PerceivedBrightness/blob/master/map_to_perceived_brightness.py) is used. We take the original image and, for each pixel, map the color to its perceive brightness. Then we display the value on the red component.

### 2. Manually sort by perceived brightness
